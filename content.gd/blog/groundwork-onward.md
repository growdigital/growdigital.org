Just published the latest updates to [Groundwork](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork), the simple Metalsmith blog template. Mostly it’s documentation, particularly tidying up documentation on the [Groundwork Rocks](https://www.groundwork.rocks) website. But as [@sonniesedge](https://twitter.com/sonniesedge) says:

> [Your regular reminder that documentation written with the assumption that someone has zero knowledge of your product or system is essential.](https://twitter.com/sonniesedge/status/943069362633826305)

Also, there’s a [Groundwork Roadmap](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/projects/1), showing issues and features. And what do features mean? You guessed it, _prizes_. Well, no, probably more like _enhanced functionality and ease of use_.
