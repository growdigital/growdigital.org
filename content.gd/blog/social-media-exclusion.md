It’s been over week now, I can’t log in to Facebook. I get the message. 

> **You can't log in at the moment**  
> We'll get in touch with you shortly after we've reviewed it. You'll now be logged out of Facebook as a security precaution. 

Is it because I use a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)? Is it because I am a (very small and quiet) champion of the [Independent Web](https://indieweb.org/)? Maybe it’s because I’ve made what is effectively a super private profile?

Whatever the reason, I will never find out. There is no due process, Facebook is a private company offering a public service without any need to explain themselves (just witness the [UK Home Affairs Select Committee](http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/724c4747-4c0e-4f98-bc89-60124dd31e87) on 19 December).

I’m wanting to use Facebook as a social media outlet for my website, in the grand tradition of [Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). The problem is, public bodies like schools are starting to rely up on social media like Facebook to disseminate information, and that’s a real issue if people are a) being excluded without reason and b) being tracked if they have a Facebook account.
