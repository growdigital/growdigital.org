# About Grow Digital

Grow Digital Ltd is mostly me, [Jake Rayson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-rayson-designer/). 

I’m a frontend developer/designer with a particular fondness for accessibility, well-crafted design systems and modular CSS. Of late, I have been learning React and JavaScript.

## Big names

Big names aren’t necessarily good names but they _are_ recognisable, and infer a degree of professionalism. Here are some big names I’ve worked for over the years: 

* Microsoft
* Vodafone
* BBC
* Orange
* Ministry of Justice
* Virgin Media

## How did you build this amazing website?

Designed in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) and [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), using the [Solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by [Ethan Schoonover](https://twitter.com/ethanschoonover). Built with [Indiego](https://github.com/growdigital/indiego/), a most awesome socially aware starter kit for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an amazing [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/).

I code with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [repository](https://github.com/growdigital/growdigital.org), and it is deployed by the magnificently simple and powerful [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) ([PRO plan _free_ for Open Source projects](https://www.netlify.com/open-source/) folks!). 

I use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write [blog posts](https://github.com/growdigital/growdigital.org/tree/master/src/posts).
