excerpt: A ground up rebuilding of the Groundwork Metalsmith blog template

---

[Groundwork](https://www.groundwork.rocks/) is my [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) blog template and Modular CSS starter kit. But. But, it’s not quite right. There’s too much fluff and messiness. I want to start afresh, and blog-along the process. This way, I’ll make sure to end up with a superlean, supernice blog template.

I am using the **super simple** `static-site` Metalsmith example:   <https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/tree/master/examples/static-site>

I will write up these incremental steps as blog posts, so that you can see the process unfurl.

First up will be, I’ve been inspired by [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)’ [@eggheadio](https://twitter.com/eggheadio) [How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-automating-releases-with-semantic-release) video and have vowed to use [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release). This is a groovy Node package that does [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for you – all you have to do is write your commit messages in a particular format.
