desc: Imagine if websites were designed by interior designers

One of [@beep](https://twitter.com/beep)’s favourite books is [How Buildings Learn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn), a cross-disciplinary goldmine full of nuggets for anyone in the building[sic] business.

A central theme is how a building is a work-in-progress, formed by how it is used.

This cropped up in conversation with a friend who’s an interior designer by trade and they highlighted the difference of approach between interior designers and architects. 

An architect will often look at an available space and design from the outside boundaries inward.*

An interior designer on the other hand **thinks foremost about how the space will be used** and designs _outward_. 

This is analagous to an accessibility-first approach to designing web sites: **how will they be used** not **what do they look like**.

\* this is obviously a gross oversimplification and I will doubtless be lambasted by the architectural profession
