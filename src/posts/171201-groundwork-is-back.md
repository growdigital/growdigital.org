After much installing of plugins and copying of code, Iâ€™ve updated [Groundwork](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork). 

I still have to tidy up the layout, which Iâ€™ll pop into the [`shame.css`](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork/blob/master/src/assets/css/shame.css). One of the biggest issues is stripping out extraneous stuff so that other users can get on with building.

I also have stopped using [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) for now, as it sadly stopped working ðŸ˜¢

A real eye-opener has been the number of downloads of Groundwork from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metalsmith-groundwork), **69** in the last day. I feel kind of bad, as it didnâ€™t really work until now (I did say so in the README). 

Groundwork is a static site blog template for web designers who want a cheap, secure and performant website, and Iâ€™ll be working to improve the experience with tutorials and blog posts.
