excerpt: Does the world really need yet another blog template?

The problem I have with [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io) (a super simnple, flexible and powerful [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/metalsmith)) is that it is super simple, flexible and powerful. 

Back in the day, when [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org) were the only way to handle workflow, I used the elegant [NestaCMS](http://nestacms.com). Now [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) is the new gem, and I searched specifically for a JavaScript static site generator. 

I chose Metalsmith because it was flexible enough to create my own [modular CSS](https://www.groundwork.rocks/principles/) workflow. But if I wanted a blog, quick, I think I would choose something else. There’s just _too much config_ for a **non-JavaScript** web designer.

With that in mind, I’ll be developing [Groundwork](https://www.groundwork.rocks) more as a **Metalsmith blog template** for web designers.
