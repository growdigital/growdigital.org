## Website

1. Get yourself a Static Site Generator. [Any one will do](https://www.staticgen.com). I like [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.com/).
2. Build yourself a blog with it. I‘ve made a blog template already called [Groundwork](https://www.groundwork.rocks/) which you can use if you like.
3. Host the blog’s repository somewhere like [GitHub](https://github.com/).
4. Now you can write Markdown text files on your mobile phone and push it to your git repo when you have an internet connection. Super low bandwidth. 

## Mobile hardware

1. Keyboard: Who’d a thunk an ex-Linux user like me would have bought something Microsoft? But I did, the [Microsoft Universal Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B010SPV1OK/), only £30ish and very nicely designed.
2. Stand: I bought a £7 [UGREEN phone holder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01ANERDRU/). It works well.
3. iPhone protection: the [Anker Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00MGE1WYG/), £5ish, nice. And the [Apple Silicone Back Cover Case](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0158JRESS), nice BUT £30, ouch.

## Mobile software

1. Editor: [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com) for iOS. £10, definitely worth it. I set up a Markdown 
[Frontmatter template]() if you’re interested (read docs to find out how to create templates for Textastic).
2. Git client: [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com). It’s a bit odd coming from using git on the command line but it works and seems pretty comprehensive and slick.
