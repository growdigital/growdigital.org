Over the years I have worked in **many** different environments: technical, social, office, you name it. From dysfunctional corporate Java behemoth, via wannabe agile headless WordPress agency, briefly stopping at .NET get-it-out backwater to hipster Django iterative startup.

The one lesson Iâ€™ve learned? **Process is more important than tools**. With my [background in Free Software and Open Source](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/web-design-and-free-software/), that takes some saying. But itâ€™s true. 

Case in point: [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). **All** PHP developers I know canâ€™t abide how WordPress is glued together with bits of baling twine and sellotape behind the shiny interface. Which is why the good folk at [Roots]() are [making lemonade with those WordPress lemons](https://roots.io/roots-on-the-changelog-podcast/). Concentrate on the process to get the best out of your tools. So, theyâ€™ve made **the best** process for WordPress, with [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/) server setup, [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) WordPress setup and [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) theme setup.

One of my **most favourite articles ever** is [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/), which Scott Walkinshaw mirrors in his [Twelve-Factor WordPress App](https://roots.io/twelve-factor-wordpress/) post. It is the ultimate in process goals, have a read ðŸ¤“.
